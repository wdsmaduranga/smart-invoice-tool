## 📖 Main Description

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I built **Smart Invoice Tool** to solve a simple problem: creating professional invoices shouldn't be complicated or expensive. Most tools out there force you to sign up, pay a subscription, or watermark your PDFs.

**Smart Invoice Tool is different:**
✨ **100% Free**: No hidden fees, no subscriptions, no watermarks.
🔒 **Privacy First**: All data is processed locally in your browser. We don't store your sensitive financial info.
⚡ **Instant**: No sign-up required. Start invoicing in seconds.
🌍 **Global**: Supports 10+ major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.) and localization.

**Key Features:**
- 📄 **Professional Invoices**: Clean, modern templates that look great.
- 💬 **Quotations**: Create estimates and convert them to invoices easily.
- 👥 **Client Management**: Save client details for faster recurring billing.
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Track revenue, pending payments, and export data.
- 📱 **Responsive**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop.

I'd love to hear your feedback! Let me know what features you'd like to see next.

## 💬 Maker's Comment (First Comment)
Hey Hunters! 😺

I'm excited to launch **Smart Invoice Tool** today!

As a freelancer myself, I was tired of "free" invoice generators that hit you with a paywall right before you download the PDF. I wanted a tool that was genuinely free, fast, and private.

So I built it!

**Smart Invoice Tool** runs entirely in your browser. Your client data and invoice details never leave your device unless you choose to create an account for cloud sync (optional).

**Key things to try:**
1. Try generating an invoice without logging in.
2. Check out the new "Quotations" feature.
3. See the "Privacy First" dashboard.

I'm here all day to answer your questions and listen to your feedback. What features would make this your go-to invoicing tool?

Thanks for your support! 🙏
